This is a very primitive Twitter API Proxy running on Google App Engine.

It simply acts as a forwarder and does not try to interpret or parse
specific api commands.


Supported API:
RESTful and Search API Methods

    Change the base API URL to:
        http://retwite.appspot.com
        or
        https://retwite.appspot.com
