This is a very primitive Twitter API Proxy running on Google App Engine.

It simply acts as a forwarder and does not try to interpret or parse
specific api commands.

Supported API:
RESTful API Methods @ http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation

Not Supported API:
Search API Methods @ http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation


We can actually add a hack for search api but seldom clients has a
seperate url setting for search api.  So it's not particularly usable.
Twitter.com will merge Search and REST API one day and things would become
easier both for you and for me.
